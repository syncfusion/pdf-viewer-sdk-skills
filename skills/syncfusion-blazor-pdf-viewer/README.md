# Syncfusion Blazor PDF Viewer Skills

Create Blazor application by integrating Syncfusion Blazor PDF Viewer control for viewing and editing PDF documents.

See **[SKILL.md](SKILL.md)** for the full intent-routing guide and rules.

## Two Modes

### Generate C# Code for the User's Project *(default)*

Produces production-ready C# code and adds it directly into the user's project files.

**Trigger keywords:** "code", "snippet", "how to write", "Program.cs", "show me", "sample", "example code", "generate code for".

## Quick Start

## Prerequisites and Setup Requirements

Before using the Blazor PDF Viewer component, ensure the following setup is complete:

### 1. NuGet Package Installation

Required packages in your `.csproj` file:

```
dotnet add package Syncfusion.Blazor.SfPdfViewer
dotnet add package Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes
```

- If the project were `Web Assembly` the install the below package too

```
dotnet add package SkiaSharp.Views.Blazor
```

### 2. Program.cs Configuration

For **Blazor Web App (Server mode) & Auto**:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Blazor;

.....

builder.Services.AddRazorComponents()
    .AddInteractiveServerComponents();

// Configure SignalR for large file uploads
builder.Services.AddSignalR(o => { o.MaximumReceiveMessageSize = 102400000; });

// Add memory cache
builder.Services.AddMemoryCache();

.......

```

For **Blazor WebAssembly**:

```csharp
using Syncfusion.Blazor;

.....

builder.Services.AddMemoryCache();
//Add Syncfusion Blazor service to the container
builder.Services.AddSyncfusionBlazor();

.....

```

For **Blazor WebAssembly or Auto mode**, register the service in both the server and client `Program.cs` files.

### 3. _Imports.razor Configuration

Add these namespaces to `Components/_Imports.razor` (Web App) or `_Imports.razor` (WebAssembly):

```cshtml
@using Syncfusion.Blazor
@using Syncfusion.Blazor.SfPdfViewer
```

### 4. App.razor Configuration

Add the Syncfusion stylesheet and script references in `Components/App.razor`:

```html
<head>
    <!-- Other head content -->
    <!-- Syncfusion Blazor PDF Viewer control's theme style sheet -->
    <link href="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.Themes/bootstrap5.css" rel="stylesheet" />
</head>

<body>
    <!-- Other body content -->
    <!-- Syncfusion Blazor PDF Viewer control's scripts -->
    <script src="_content/Syncfusion.Blazor.SfPdfViewer/scripts/syncfusion-blazor-sfpdfviewer.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
</body>
```

### Example Prompts

#### Mode 1 / Code-Generation Prompts (C# snippets for your project)

*Use these when you want C# code to embed in your project (e.g., Program.cs).*

**Examples:**

- "Show me the C# code to create a Pdfviewer with the hide the default toolbar."
- "Generate a C# snippet to add the annotations programmatically for Pdfviewer."
- "Provide C# code to customize the UI for the search functionalities for Pdfviewer."
- "Show me how to set the formfieldsettings for the Pdfviewer"
